  Description:
    Abstract: Much new geologic data has been accumulated since A. Quinn published the Rhode Island Geologic Map in 1971. This dataset incorporates recent data.  It is presented in digital format at a scale of 1:100,000.
    Purpose: The 1994 published Geologic Map of Rhode Island was made from the digital data contained here. The compiled digital database provides users with complete GIS capabilities. The coding of the topology is designed to permit easy use and manipulation of geologic information in the database by the user.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Created attributes are consistent in both thematic database and the spatial coverage.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: No specific test were performed. However data are thought to be logically consistent because attribute information for the same spatial entities were read from the same source file.
  Completeness_Report: Geologic boundaries were digitized from stable Mylar at a map scale of 1:100,000. Shoreline, lakes and pond boundaries are from United States Geological Survey DLG files that were digitized at a scale of 1:100,000.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Most geologic boundaries originated from 1:24,000 and 1:31,680 quadrangle geologic maps. After generalizing these boundaries to a scale of 1:100,000 , they were scribed on a stable Mylar base. These boundaries were then digitized in Arc/Info using a Calcomp9100 digitizer.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Most geologic boundaries originated from 1:24,000 and 1:31,000 quadrangle geologic maps. After generalizing these boundaries for the scale of 1:100,000 , they were scribed on a stable Mylar base. These boundaries were then digitized in Arc/Info using a Calcomp9100 digitizer with RMS =< 005. Shoreline, lakes and pond boundaries were copied from United Geological Survey 1:100,000 scale DLG files. Both geologic boundaries and units attributes are coded. The coding of the topology is designed to allow easy manipulation of geological information in the database by users.
