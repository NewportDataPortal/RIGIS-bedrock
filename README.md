Much new geologic data has been accumulated since A. Quinn published the Rhode Island Geologic Map in 1971. This dataset incorporates recent data.  It is presented in digital format at a scale of 1:100,000.

The 1994 published Geologic Map of Rhode Island was made from the digital data contained here. The compiled digital database provides users with complete GIS capabilities. The coding of the topology is designed to permit easy use and manipulation of geologic information in the database by the user.
